# The shop and entitlement services

Date: 2026-11-02. Build: Steam `25810808` (`NewWorld.exe` MD5 `ac8791b8…`). Labels: **Observed**
(seen in code, data, a log or a capture), **Inferred** (concluded from observed facts), **Unknown**
(not established).

## Summary for a non-programmer

- After login our client called Amazon's shop service once (`2026-11-02-region-ping.md`,
  section 3).
- The client takes the shop addresses from three remote config keys. Retail leaves them empty,
  so the client used its built-in Amazon addresses.
- Now our remote config fills the keys with our game host, the same way it fills the
  leaderboard address, and our server answers the shop calls: no items for sale, no
  entitlements.

## 1. Evidence

### 1.1 The client code

- **Observed.** `FUN_1416190f0` (Ghidra sweep `local-data/re-sweep`) makes the
  `FcsEndpointClient`. It reads `omni.fcs.assume-role`, `omni.fcs.region`,
  `omni.fcs.endpoints.catalog-service`, `omni.fcs.endpoints.entitlement-service` and
  `omni.fcs.endpoints.transaction-service` with `FUN_140fcb290`, and gives the region and the
  catalog endpoint to `FUN_1417230a0`, which builds the client configuration
  (`Aws::Catalog::CatalogClient`). The leaderboard client `FUN_141627230` reads
  `omni.leaderboards.*` the same way, and our remote config already sets
  `omni.leaderboards.client-endpoint` to `game.<domain>` (`2026-09-18-leaderboards-and-analytics.md`).
- **Inferred.** With an empty endpoint key the client uses the SDK's built-in host:
  `client.catalogservice.amazongames.com`, `client.entitlementservice.amazongames.com` or
  `client.transactionservice.amazongames.com`.

### 1.2 Retail remote config and our live run

- **Observed.** The retail remote config capture (`local-data/remote-config/retail-2026-09-18`)
  has no `fcs` key.
- **Observed (live run 2026-11-02).** For about 15 s after login our client held a connection to
  `34.195.204.23:443`, one of the two addresses of both the catalog and the entitlement host.

### 1.3 Retail calls and replies

From the retail captures under `local-data/captures` (folders `catalog` and `entitlements`):

| Call | Reply |
|---|---|
| `GET /players/<persona>/games/new-world/platforms/steam/catalog?type=MTX` | `200` JSON: `currencyCode`, `offers` (365), `countryCode`, `etag`; or `304` |
| `GET .../stores/<alias>` (`Featured`, `Seasonal`, `Special1`, `Special2`) | `200` JSON: `currencyCode`, `stores` (one store: `alias`, `metadata`, `nextScheduleStartDate`, `slots`), `countryCode`, `etag`; or `304` |
| `GET .../entitlements` | `200` JSON: `hasMoreResults`, `entitlements` (100 a page), `paginationToken` |
| `POST .../entitlements/sync` with `{"syncTypes": [5 names]}` | `202` with no body |

- **Observed.** The catalog and store replies carry the same value in the `ETag` header (no
  quotes) and in the `etag` member: 44 base64 characters. A `304` has
  `Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8`. The JSON replies have
  `Content-Type: application/json`.
- **Observed.** The capture of the privacy settings service (`POST .../privacy-settings`) is a
  separate host, read from `omni.privacy-settings.client-endpoint` (`FUN_14160ad60`). Our live
  run showed no connection to it.
- **Observed** (`captures/ow captures extracted/unlock_store_content-a3d37ef02324761e/privacy`, call 52):
  `POST /players/<persona>/games/new-world/privacy-settings` on
  `client.agsprivacysettingsservice.amazongames.com`, body `{"settings": [5 names]}` (friend
  requests, online status, private text, public or group text, voice). Reply `200`
  `application/json`: one entry per name, each `value` and `defaultValue` `Everyone`, `status`
  `DEFAULT`, its `allowedValues`, `errorCode` and `lastUpdateDate` `null`, `lastUpdateTimeMs` 0;
  the reply's order is not the request's. `FUN_14160ad60` reads
  `omni.privacy-settings.assume-role`, `.region` and `.client-endpoint`, the same shape as the
  leaderboard client.

## 2. What the server does

- `crates/nw-login/src/remote_config.rs` fills `GAME_HOST_ENDPOINTS` of the publicGameplay
  `RegionId` layer with `game.<domain>`: the leaderboard key and the three `omni.fcs.endpoints.*`
  keys. The tracked layer has `omni.fcs.region` `us-east-1` and an empty `omni.fcs.endpoints`
  object; the server refuses a file that sets one of the keys itself.
- `crates/nw-login/src/shop.rs` serves on `game.<domain>`: a catalog with one free offer per
  mount of the store table (2026-11-04, below), one hidden store with one empty static slot for
  each alias (every one of the 1,029 retail store replies in the captures had one to six; with no slot the change
  mount screen kept spinning, live 2026-11-04), the entitlement list of the player's account,
  and `202` for a sync. The catalog and store replies have an ETag (base64 of the SHA-256 of the
  reply with an empty `etag`) and answer `304` to it, named in `x-amzn-if-none-match` (the
  client's header, live 2026-11-04) or `If-None-Match`. A free offer shows a 99 % discount (every
  free price of the `unlock_store_content` catalog: 1,872 of 1,872).
- An offer's `alias` is its mount's store product (`javelindata_storeproducts` `UniqueTagID`
  with the mount's `DisplayName`, the variant telling two apart): retail `Mount_Wolf_1`,
  `Mount_Bear_MTX7_Ronin` (Observed, `unlock_store_content` catalog). The client leaves out an
  offer whose alias names no product, so the 5 store mounts without one are not sold (47 of 52).
  Each call is logged (`store call`: method, path, query, header names, status).

### 2.1 Free store mounts (2026-11-04)

- **Observed** (`captures/own/mount-menu-buying-all-store-horses`, retail in its last weeks): the
  store sold every mount for 0 Marks of Fortune. A purchase is the game call 898
  (`EntitlementComponentServerFacet_ClientInitializeTransaction`: locale, request id, offer id,
  currency, price); the server answers 5936 `OnRequestInitialized` (0.12 s) and 1285
  `OnRequestSuccess` (0.24 s), both with the request id and a transaction number; 1285 lists the
  bought entitlement (`Ent_Mount_MTX_7_bear_Ronin`, its instance UUID, the time) and the wallet.
  Layout: `crates/nw-messages/src/store.rs`, tested on the retail bytes.
- The store table (`content-tool store` -> `local-data/content/store-<build>.json`,
  `[shop] store_table`): every enabled `javelindata_entitlements` row with `RewardType` `Mount`
  and `SourceType` `Store` (52), and the entitlements they require
  (`Ent_Xpack_RiseOfTheAngryEarth_Owner`), which every account holds (Inferred).
- An offer's id and its entitlement's id are the entitlement's `UniqueTagID` (Inferred: the
  client sends the offer id back in 898 and matches entitlements by alias).
- `[shop] enabled` turns the store on or off (off: an empty catalog, purchases refused, the
  account keeps what it got). `[shop] free` sells every mount for 0; off, a mount costs
  `mount_price` (or its `[shop.mount_prices]` entry) in Marks of Fortune from the account's
  wallet (`account_wallet`; `blighted-admin give-marks`). The entitlement list holds the wallet
  as retail did (`type` `Wallet`, `freeAmount`, `paidAmount`, `pendingAmount`, `lossAmount`,
  `totalAmount`; every Mark of this server is free).
- The sim answers 898 for an offer of the table: 5936 at once, then it pays and saves the
  entitlement in the global database in one transaction (global migration 0005) and answers
  1285 with it and the wallet (kind 2; amounts free, paid, pending, Inferred from retail 8000,
  5000, 0 beside a total of 13000). A wallet below the price gets no answer (retail's
  3113 `OnRequestFail` has no capture). The director gives each joining player its
  account's entitlements, and a handoff carries them; a store mount is usable when its
  entitlement is held.
- **Unknown.** Retail's answer to a refused purchase; this server sends none. Whether the client
  sends anything to these routes that proves which account asks: the store call log shows the
  header names of a live run.
- **Inferred.** `currencyCode` `USD` and `countryCode` `US`: retail answers in the player's own
  currency and country, and this server has one region.
- **Inferred.** The last entitlement page leaves out `paginationToken`; no retail last page was
  captured.
- The purchase service (`transaction-service`) points at `game.<domain>` too, so a purchase never
  reaches Amazon. This server has no purchase route; it answers `404` (the game buys through 898,
  section 2.1).

### 2.2 Privacy settings (2026-11-04)

- The remote config fills `omni.privacy-settings.client-endpoint` with `game.<domain>` (the
  same fill as the shop keys); the tracked layer sets `omni.privacy-settings.region`
  `us-east-1` (Inferred: the region of the other services).
- `crates/nw-login/src/privacy.rs` answers the settings post on `game.<domain>` with the retail
  defaults of each known setting the request names, in the retail reply's order. The retail
  request gets the retail reply byte for byte (test). A name the service does not know gets no
  entry (Inferred: no capture). This server keeps no privacy settings and has no route that
  changes one (no retail capture of a change).

## 3. Live check (Linux, 2026-11-02)

- **Observed.** After a new game start, at character select, the game held connections only to
  our server (`127.0.0.1:443`, `127.0.0.1:80`) and to a local port, for 40 s. edge-http counted
  one `202`, the reply only an entitlement sync gets.

## 4. Unknown

1. How the shop screen shows an empty catalog and no stores. A live run with the shop screen
   open answers it.
2. Whether our client calls the privacy settings service, and when. Its endpoint key is set
   since 2026-11-04 and the server answers as retail; no live run has shown the call yet.
