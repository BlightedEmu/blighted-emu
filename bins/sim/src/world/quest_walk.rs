//! The quest walk's character: a test player that plays one quest in a world of its own
//! (`sim quest-walk`). It takes the quest, plays its steps and turns it in through the calls a
//! game client makes (the talk with the NPC, the accept, the territory entries, the finished
//! topics, the cinematics and screens, the faction pick, the turn-in). A step whose client flow
//! it does not drive (a kill, a gather, a craft, a catch) is played as the game event the server
//! makes of that flow, after a check that the level holds what the step needs: a mob of the
//! type, a gatherable or another source of the item, a recipe, a place. A step it cannot check
//! or play stops the walk of its quest with the reason.
