//! Travel (run 15 travel study, scripts in `local-data/scratch-work/run15/travel`): fast travel to
//! a landmark or a home, unstuck, the map marker, the respawn points a player binds (an inn, a
//! respawn camp), territory discovery, door passes, and the house plot and furniture calls.
//!
//! Retail order and timing, from the captures:
//! - A fast travel (3713 to a landmark, 3712 to a home) channels [`TravelRules::channel_ms`]; the
//!   server then sends the loading screen (3951, flag 1) and the end of the channel (3696) and
//!   moves the player. A movement key during the channel cancels it with 3042 (7 of 8 cancels of
//!   the cancel capture came 25 to 30 ms after the first record with the forward key; no travel
//!   that ended had one). A travel to a settlement or a shrine takes its azoth at the end of the
//!   channel, in the ms of the loading screen (travel cost survey of 2026-10-31); an inn recall
//!   and a home travel take none. A destination in another sim's cells hands the player over once
//!   the move's own states are out.
//! - An unstuck (388) is accepted at once (3980, the wait in nanoseconds) and moves the player
//!   after the wait (2190) to the oldest of its breadcrumbs (Inferred: 31 retail landings were on
//!   the player's own trail, 39 to 264 m back); it is denied (2774) while dead, while one runs, on
//!   cooldown, or without breadcrumbs, with the cooldown left. A failed move ends the cooldown
//!   (retail asked again 54 s after one and was accepted). The player kneels while it waits and
//!   may not interact, and stands up at the move ([`super::slayer`]'s unstuck kneel).
//! - A map marker (2728) comes back as the waypoints state (4321) in the next bundle.
//! - Binding a respawn camp (interaction 73) demolishes the player's own camp (6760, every one of
//!   8 retail binds; its entity goes and the save forgets it) and is accepted (3743); checking in
//!   at an inn (70, then 18) is accepted.
//!   The bound ids are the ids a respawn request (1938) names.
//! - A door (67) is accepted and its client moves through it on its own, 4.7 to 5.6 m, 134 to
//!   267 ms after the answer (3 retail doors): that one move is taken.
//!
//! The run 15 travel2 study (`local-data/scratch-work/run15/travel2`) adds:
//! - The player's travel states after its card, and again after each change: the player time
//!   (3290), the housing state (2768) with its owned houses, the home points (3652) its respawn
//!   screen lists (the bound inn, the houses, the placed camp) and the camping state (1292).
//! - An inn recall is a 3713 of landmark type `InnRespawn` (20; 61 retail recalls): it goes to
//!   the bound inn, at most once per the inn home point's cooldown (900 s in every retail one).
//! - The fast travel azoth cost is the client's formula ([`crate::travel_rules::FastTravelCosts`])
//!   with the values retail charges: 20 azoth, half within the player's territory (203 paid
//!   retail travels of 256 ledgers). 63 retail travels were free; why is Unknown.
//! - A house plot's type comes from the level (`HousingPlotComponent.m_houseTypeString`): its
//!   cost, the level rule of `javelin.housing.house-level-reqs`, one house per territory, the
//!   weekly tax (due 7 days after the purchase or the last payment), the home fast travel
//!   cooldown of its type and its reset for azoth (1998: `max(10, 200 * left / cooldown)`, the
//!   cooldown ends at once, no answer but the housing state). Placed furniture leaves the bag
//!   (the 3277 item is the client item index: the housing rows after the other items) and comes
//!   back when picked up.
//! - A teleporter (interaction 82) is a capital whose slice holds its destination; retail answered
//!   and moved the player 1 s later (or after the fast travel channel for `m_channelDuration`
//!   0) with 3951 and 3696.
//! - A camp (2236 from build mode, answered by 441; a former camp goes with 6760, as retail's
//!   second placement) needs the `Camping` rank (its tier), a territory with `CanPlaceCamp`, the
//!   blueprint the 2236 names (or the default camp of its tier; a PvP-flagged player's is the
//!   blueprint's `PvPCampVariantID`), an enabled skin whose achievement the player has, and its
//!   `StructureCost` items in the bag, which leave it as the owner builds the camp. It stands in
//!   the world as an entity ([`super::camps`], with its build stage); the camping state (1292) names it and its bind cooldown end (placement
//!   plus [`CAMP_BIND_COOLDOWN_MS`]), the home points (3652) list its respawn point.
