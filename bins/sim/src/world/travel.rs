//! Travel (run 15 travel study, scripts in `local-data/scratch-work/run15/travel`): fast travel to
//! a landmark or a home, unstuck, the map marker, the respawn points a player binds (an inn, a
//! respawn camp), territory discovery, door passes, and the house plot and furniture calls.
//!
//! Retail order and timing, from the captures:
//! - A fast travel (3713 to a landmark, 3712 to a home) channels [`TravelRules::channel_ms`]; the
//!   server then sends the loading screen (3951, flag 1) and the end of the channel (3696) and
//!   moves the player. A movement key during the channel cancels it with 3042 (7 of 8 cancels of
//!   the cancel capture came 25 to 30 ms after the first record with the forward key; no travel
//!   that ended had one). Retail took no Azoth: no `Azoth_Currency` change followed any of 7
//!   travels of two characters. A destination in another sim's cells hands the player over once
//!   the move's own states are out.
//! - An unstuck (388) is accepted at once (3980, the wait in nanoseconds) and moves the player
//!   after the wait (2190) to the oldest of its breadcrumbs (Inferred: 31 retail landings were on
//!   the player's own trail, 39 to 264 m back); it is denied (2774) while dead, while one runs, on
//!   cooldown, or without breadcrumbs, with the cooldown left. A failed move ends the cooldown
//!   (retail asked again 54 s after one and was accepted).
//! - A map marker (2728) comes back as the waypoints state (4321) in the next bundle.
//! - Binding a respawn camp (interaction 73) demolishes the player's own camp (6760, every one of
//!   8 retail binds) and is accepted (3743); checking in at an inn (70, then 18) is accepted.
//!   The bound ids are the ids a respawn request (1938) names.
//! - A door (67) is accepted and its client moves through it on its own, 4.7 to 5.6 m, 134 to
//!   267 ms after the answer (3 retail doors): that one move is taken.
//!
//! The run 15 travel2 study (`local-data/scratch-work/run15/travel2`) adds:
//! - The player's travel states after its card, and again after each change: the player time
//!   (3290), the housing state (2768) with its owned houses, the home points (3652) its respawn
//!   screen lists (the bound inn, the houses, the placed camp) and the camping state (1292).
//! - An inn recall is a 3713 of landmark type `InnRespawn` (20; 61 retail recalls): it goes to
//!   the bound inn, at most once per the inn home point's cooldown (900 s in every retail one).
//! - The fast travel azoth cost is the client's formula ([`crate::travel_rules::FastTravelCosts`]);
//!   retail runs it disabled (no azoth left the wallet in 7 travels), and so does this server
//!   unless a layer sets `javelin.playtest-disable-fast-travel-costs` false.
//! - A house plot's type comes from the level (`HousingPlotComponent.m_houseTypeString`): its
//!   cost, the level rule of `javelin.housing.house-level-reqs`, one house per territory, the
//!   weekly tax (due 7 days after the purchase or the last payment), the home fast travel
//!   cooldown of its type and its reset for azoth (1998: `max(10, 200 * left / cooldown)`, the
//!   cooldown ends at once, no answer but the housing state). Placed furniture leaves the bag
//!   (the 3277 item is the client item index: the housing rows after the other items) and comes
//!   back when picked up.
//! - A teleporter (interaction 82) is a capital whose slice holds its destination; retail answered
//!   and moved the player 1 s later (or after the fast travel channel for `m_channelDuration`
//!   0) with 3951 and 3696.
//! - A camp (2236 from build mode, answered by 441; a former camp goes with 6760, as retail's
//!   second placement) needs the `Camping` rank (its tier) and a territory with `CanPlaceCamp`.
