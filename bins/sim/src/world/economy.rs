//! The economy of this sim's players (economy note `local-data/scratch-work/run15/economy`):
//! the trading post, player trades, the store flag and the season and reward calls.
//!
//! The trading post's orders are the world's (world database, [`nw_db::post_order`] and the
//! other order calls): a call becomes an [`EconomyJob`] that the loop runs in its own task, and
//! the [`EconomyResult`] comes back between ticks. The sim takes what a player gives (coins, the
//! units of a sell order or a buy order's sale) before the job and gives it back when the job
//! fails, is refused, or its player is gone (then as a delivery of the world database). What a
//! player receives always arrives as a delivery that its sim takes ([`SimWorld::economy_round`]
//! and after each own call), so a sale on another sim reaches the seller wherever it plays.
//!
//! A player trade runs in this sim: both players are near each other (retail refuses
//! `PlayersOutOfRange`). Each offer change shows in the trade state of both players; when both
//! confirmed their locked offers, the coins and items move at once and the move is audited.
//!
//! A shop purchase (3741) is one row of the shop offers ([`crate::shop`]): the sim checks the
//! row's rank, takes its coins, items and progression points, and gives its items or its
//! achievement at once, all or nothing. A row with a cooldown first claims the purchase in the
//! world database, so the cooldown holds on every sim; a claim whose purchase then fails is
//! given back.
