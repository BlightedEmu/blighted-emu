//! A player's weapon masteries as its client keeps them (docs/re/2026-09-18-progression-and-gm-
//! mode.md sections 2 and 4): the categorical progression list (type 911) and the weapon point
//! pools (type 3681). The sim keeps the total experience of each mastery; the rank and the
//! points inside it come from the rank table. Each rank gives one point of the weapon's pool;
//! the client assigns them to the progression points of the weapon's tree (1112), and the
//! applied active abilities go into the weapon table's mapped slots (2857, type 185;
//! docs/re/2026-09-18-progression-and-gm-mode.md section 6). The client moves an ability into a
//! slot (2701) and resets a weapon tree for azoth (186, answered by 2858; progression note,
//! section 9). The list holds every other categorical progression the player has too: the
//! tradeskills, the ranked ones and the currencies (`Azoth_Currency`, whose points are the
//! azoth balance).
