//! The slayer state of a player (slayer note, 2026-09-18; movement study 2026-09-20; run-15 lock
//! and aim study 2026-09-22): the action it plays, which the client and the other players see in
//! the ALC children 13 to 24 and 48, and the time into that action's sequence (children 2 and 3).
//!
//! The client starts some actions itself and names each one in row 1 of its input
//! ([`SlayerInput`]); the server echoes it in the next own state, started in the state numbered
//! with that record's counter, then adds its follow-up for some of them. Every other action is
//! the server's (Observed, retail newchar capture 2026-09-18; the client waits for them): the
//! light attack at the release of a tap of the attack key, the charge after a hold, the dodge,
//! the jump, the block and the aim of the right-click, the weapon draw and the movement states.
//! Runs 13 and 15 sent none of the attack starts: their clients started no attack at all (37 and
//! 103 taps, every one shorter than the hold; retail's server started the first attack of each
//! chain at the release, 463 at record 0x6bd after the press at 0x6ba). The sequences come from
//! the player sequence table ([`PlayerSequences`]) by the weapon's stance.
//!
//! The sequence time is the sum of the input records' frame times since the record that started
//! the state, that record's own included ([`SequenceClock`] has the wire form).
