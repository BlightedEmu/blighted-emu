//! GM chat commands. The retail client has no menu or console command that sends its GM calls
//! (docs/re/2026-09-18-admin-studio-s10-gm-study.md), so a game master types them in chat: a
//! line that starts with [`GM_COMMAND_PREFIX`], on any channel. The sim takes the line before
//! the social service does, runs it as the admin command of the same name and answers the
//! sender alone with system lines. A line of a player without the game master rank is chat.
//!
//! A command acts on its sender, or on the player of this sim named by one more word at its
//! end. Levels and ranks are as the client shows them (1 is the first); coins are as the admin
//! site takes them.
