//! Weapon abilities (abilities design note and ability-use-wire note, 2026-10-31): the server runs
//! the ability list of the weapon in the hand as the client does. A press of ability key 1, 2 or 3
//! (input 402, 115, 139) names the ability mapped to that key; the list's actions start while
//! their activation holds and stop when their deactivation holds, tested against the player
//! ([`CageWorld`]). The action that tests the pressed ability starts a chain; its follow-ups (the
//! actions that test what the chain runs) belong to the same chain, and each action starts at
//! most once per chain. A running action starts its cooldowns and applies its status effects
//! when it starts, and casts each of its spells once, when the cast's branch conditions hold;
//! a cast spends its spell's mana (retail: the cost is the `SpellData` `ManaCost`).
//!
//! Observed (general-other-01): the cooldown change (2932 `cdmapN`, N the pressed key) and the
//! mana spend go out in one bundle; mana comes back at 3.259 per second in steps every 50 ms,
//! with no pause after a spend. Inferred: the cooldown starts when its action starts (retail
//! sends it at the cast, 160 to 935 ms after the press).
