//! Mounts (mounts study, run 15: `local-data/scratch-work/run15/mounts/REPORT.md`; 20 retail
//! ledgers with mounts): the summon, the ride and the dismount, the mount stamina, the chosen
//! mount and its dye and name, and what other players see of a rider.
//!
//! The retail flow (Mount-quest capture, 13 summons and 13 dismounts):
//! - The summon key (input 26) starts a summon: the server sends 5747 with the type's
//!   `SummonTimeMs`, then the chosen mount in the own state's `m_mountId`. When the summon time
//!   is over it authorizes the summon (`m_summonAuthorization`: 1 and 8 s after the start); the
//!   client then asks to mount (6068, 13 ms later) and the server sets `m_isMounted` with the
//!   mount's stamina rates. A summon key while riding gets the player off: 5937 with the reason,
//!   `m_isMounted` 0, the authorization cleared and the summon cooldown 1 s ahead (the type's
//!   dismount cooldown). A refused or cancelled summon gets 5752 with its reason.
//! - The mount stamina drains while the rider dashes on the move (the dash key is the dodge key,
//!   held or toggled as 6268 says) and regenerates after its delay; at 0 the dash ends and the
//!   delay starts again (retail regen delay 1.0 then 0.967, 0.933 ... per tick).
//! - Deep water gets the rider off (5937 `DeepWater`); a cutscene makes the client ask (5751).
//!
//! The server's body of a rider moves at the mount's speeds ([`nw_sim_core::MountPaces`]) of the
//! `MountMovementData` row its riding rank picks.
