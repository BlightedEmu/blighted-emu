//! The tutorial of one player (live-tutorial note): its quest's task tree, its fights and its
//! move into the water.
//!
//! The quest `01_SoleSurvivor2` runs as a task tree ([`crate::objectives`]); the achievements it
//! sets unlock the client's videos, cutscenes, hints and doors. Beside the tree, the server runs
//! what the level's encounters do on retail:
//!
//! - The ship fight (`ftue_v2_enc_boatwreck`): one corrupted sailor waits near the player until
//!   the client ends its quick-time lesson (6638), then fights; when it dies, two more come.
//! - While the ship-sinking video plays, the player moves into the water (retail: 13.5 s after
//!   the video started, with no loading screen).
//! - Later fights start when tasks of the tree are done: the legionnaire after the ruin door, the
//!   signifier at the first fight area, the corruption entity and its swarmers at the climb, and
//!   Thorpe after the fountain cutscene.
//! - Thorpe is not killed by a hit on retail (tutorial-ai note, section 6): at 60 % health he
//!   stops for an intermission, heals to full and comes back; at 50 % of his second health bar
//!   his scripted death comes, and the client starts the next cutscene. His death is no kill of
//!   the quest.
//! - The island's static entities (ftue-static-entities note) show after the move into the water.
//! - The beach bag: after the client takes all its items (2939), retail completes two of its
//!   delayed events and removes it.
//! - The ruin chest: the client starts the interaction in its input; the server accepts it, and
//!   after the gather time ends it and gives two health potions.
//!
//! Every mob of the tutorial is personal: only its player sees it. A dead mob's body stays for
//! its kind's retail time, then it goes.
//!
//! How the mobs fight: a mob whose slice names a tree Server.pak has runs it (the risen
//! `corruptionentity_base` and the swarmers `corruptionswarmer_base`; `crate::mob_ai`). Three
//! have no tree in Server.pak (behavior-tree study, section 4.1, Observed: the club sailors'
//! `drowned/ftue/drowned_qte_basebehavior`, the legionnaires' `legion/legion_ftue/
//! legion_ftue_basebehavior`, Thorpe's `quest_npcs/ftue_thorpe_v2/ftue_thorpe_v2_basebehavior`;
//! the trace replay showed that no tree in the pak plays what they played, trace finding b):
//! they keep the paces measured from the retail tutorial below.
