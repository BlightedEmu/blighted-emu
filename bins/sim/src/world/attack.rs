//! Attacks, hits and player health (M6-A spec sections 7 and 8).
//!
//! [`SimWorld::attack`] is the one attack of a player: it checks the attack (parent spec section
//! 9: range and attack rate), rolls the hit, and applies it with [`SimWorld::apply_hit`], which
//! mob attacks and hits from other sims use too. A player at 0 health is dead: it cannot move or
//! attack, every mob forgets it, its character is saved at once, and it lives again with full
//! health where it died when its client asks (M6-B spec section 8).
//!
//! Hits and deaths send messages (M6-B spec section 7): a hit made sends the attacker a 2071, a
//! hit applied on a player sends it a 3601, and a death a 4299. A mob's melee hit on a player
//! sends it a 2218; while the player holds block, the hit does no damage and the 2218 says so
//! (live-tutorial note, section 7). They wait in the world until
//! [`SimWorld::take_messages`] or the tick takes them.
//!
//! [`SimWorld::attack_input`] turns the attack bits of a client's input records into the basic
//! attacks of the weapon's stance ([`nw_content::player_attacks`]): a press during an attack's
//! combo link starts the link's step, else the stance's first; the hold picks the step's light,
//! heavy or charged attack. A melee attack sweeps its `CAGE-Damage` shapes through their windows
//! against every target ([`SimWorld::sweep`]); a projectile or a hit scan fires
//! ([`SimWorld::player_swings_due`]). A stance effect the player holds gives the stance's variant
//! ([`nw_content::player_attacks::Stance::with_effects`]).
