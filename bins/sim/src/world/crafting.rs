//! Crafting at a station (beach-quests note, section 4). The player opens a station (interaction
//! kind 20; the server answers with the station's name and the player's interactor target), sends
//! the recipe, how many crafts, the fee its client shows and the ingredients it picked (2997),
//! and 1,057 ms later the server answers with the recipe and the crafts made and an idle update
//! (2993 twice; retail: 1,022 to 1,110 ms for 1 to 85 crafts alike, 34 crafts of four crafting
//! ledgers). The close of the window (2999) gets one more idle update.
//!
//! A craft needs a station of the recipe's name and tier ([`Recipe::made_at`]), its tradeskill's
//! rank at the recipe's `RecipeLevel`, the ingredients in the bag and the fee in the wallet: the
//! recipes' `CraftingFee` at the territory's crafting or refining fee
//! ([`super::land_claims::station_fee`]), whatever fee the client sent (retail took the client's
//! shown fee at 34 of 34 crafts, so the shown fee is the server's own; the territory standing
//! discount that lowers it is Unknown and not run here). Each craft fires the recipe's game
//! event: its tradeskill experience
//! ([`SimWorld::grant_event`]).
//!
//! The stations are the level's ([`nw_world::stations`]): a client shows a station's interaction
//! only once it has the station's spawn group (campfire note: retail sends it when the station
//! comes into view; run 12 sent none and the beach campfire had no prompt). The group holds the
//! card and a state per replicated component of the station's slice, at the slice's component
//! numbers ([`station_members`]).
