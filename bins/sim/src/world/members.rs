//! The bundle groups of the entities a client sees (world-entry note, "Spawn condition traced").
//! Each entity is one group in its own slot ([`super::slots`]); the own player is slot
//! [`LOCAL_PLAYER_INTEREST`]. A group holds the entity's spawn card (type 10, component
//! [`GDE_METADATA_COMPONENT`]) when the entity comes into view (and again once per
//! [`CARD_REFRESH_BUNDLES`] bundles while it stays in view), then its position in an
//! `ALCReplicatedState` (type 11) carrying the `pos10` child, as the retail bundles do. A player's
//! card names the player prefab ([`PLAYER_SLICE_ASSET`]): the client registers its local player
//! only when that prefab is portrayed in slot 1. A mob's card ids are our own values: the mob
//! prefab is Unknown.
//!
//! Bundles split by bytes: an unreliable carrier message must fit one datagram (it is never
//! chunked), so a bundle's groups and stops take at most the bytes of [`MAX_BUNDLE_MEMBERS`]
//! position members, as before M6-B.
