//! Fishing (run 15 fishing study; retail `open-world/Fishing`, `gather_node_20260912` and the
//! feed-the-fire side quest): the server's fishing state machine, replicated as the own fishing
//! state ([`FishingComponentState`]), driven by the client's keys and its acknowledgements.
//!
//! The fishing key takes the pole of paperdoll slot 37 out (`StartedEquippingFishing`, then
//! `FishingEquipped` [`EQUIP_MS`] later) and puts it away (`FishingEnded` and `FishingUnequipped`
//! [`UNEQUIP_MS`] later). With the pole out, the bait key opens the bait window
//! (`ApplyingBait`); its 2309 applies a bait (answered by 557) and the pole is out again. The
//! attack key charges a cast while it is held (`CastStart`; the cast bar fills in 2 s, then falls
//! back) and casts at its release (`CastEnd`): the bobber flies and lands (2444, then
//! `CastHitWater` and `FishingStarted`, or `Failed_CastHitLand` on land). A fish nibbles after
//! the water's (or the hotspot's) nibble time, bites after the bite time, and the bite window
//! stays open 1 s; the attack key in it sets the hook (3172 with the catch, `HookHit`), a press
//! during the nibble misses (`Failed_HookMissedTooEarly`), no press misses too
//! (`Failed_HookMissedTooLate`), and a press while waiting ends the cast. After the hook the line
//! rests (`ReelingRecover`); holding the attack key reels (`ReelingActive`). Reeling brings the
//! fish in at the pole's speed and strains the line, resting lets the fish swim out and the line
//! recover; the fish fights or tires in 2 s blocks after its behavior's pattern. A line at the top
//! tension breaks (`Failed_LineBreak`); a fish brought all the way in is caught
//! (`Succeeded_FishCaught`): the item, the fishing experience and the catch event's rewards.
//! After a catch or a failure the cast ends (`FishingEnded`, `FishingEquipped`).
//!
//! The bait goes on the hook at the cast's end (Observed: the bag lost one at `CastEnd`, twice)
//! and comes back after the cast unless its `FishingData` loss chance takes it.
