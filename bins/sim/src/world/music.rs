//! Musical performances (run 15 music study; retail `open-world/Music`,
//! `music_abort_current_song`, `20261010-113829-464` and the play-for-the-town side quest).
//!
//! A player with an instrument in an instrument slot creates a performance (4891): the server
//! spawns the performance entity (its spawn group: the card of slice `ffce76a6...` sub 2, the
//! performance state at component 2 and the position) and answers with its id (4869), or
//! refuses with the reason, the zone radius and the zone type (4889). The performance waits to
//! be joined, then shows its pre show; the performer picks a song (4867), a sheet (4879) and a
//! reward (5022) and starts (4865): the clients load the song (`PreLoad`), the performer's client
//! says it is ready (5091), the song plays from the start time the state names, and each note the
//! performer plays comes in (4892). At the song's end plus 1.05 s the results show the score
//! (`performerScore`, `performanceScore`) and the performer gets the `Musician` experience of the
//! song's completion event; the post show follows 3.05 s later, and the performance is done at
//! the 5233 or 15 s later and goes back to its pre show. A song can be stopped (5417). Leaving
//! (4881) ends the performance (`Ending`; the group goes 5.03 s later) and starts the
//! performer's lockout (`lockoutDuration` 40, cleared 10 s later; persisted as
//! `MusicalPerformancePlayerPersistence.m_nextPerformanceStartTime`).
//!
//! Every player within the zone radius watches the performance (`observingPerformanceId`) and
//! counts in `performanceZonePlayerCount`. A viewer outside the zone gets slot 0 of the state, a
//! viewer in the zone slots 0 and 1, the performer every slot (Observed).
