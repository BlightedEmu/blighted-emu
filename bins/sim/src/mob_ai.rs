//! Mob AI from the game's own data (behavior-tree study 2026-09-18, sections 3 and 5): each mob
//! of a creature slice whose tree Server.pak has runs that tree (`nw_ai::Brain`), with the slice's
//! config values, vision, navigation configs and CAGE grid from the AI data file
//! (`ai-data-<build>.bin`, `content-tool ai-data`). This module holds the shared data, the design
//! files' overrides of a spawn, and one mob's mind: what it perceives, what the engine keys of
//! its tree read, and how its tree's commands move and animate it.
//!
//! Marks: **Observed** (read in the data or the capture), **Inferred** (follows from them, not
//! seen run), **Unknown** (not found).
//!
//! What the engine keys are (the writers in the client are Unknown, study section 3.1):
//! - `Has_Target`, `Target_Pos`: the mob's target (see [`TreeMind::perceive`]).
//! - `Target_Dist`: horizontal metres (Inferred: the boar's 3 m and 7 m bands fit the retail
//!   attack starts at 1.69 to 5.30 m; `content-tool` `ai_replay`).
//! - `Target_Angle`: signed degrees from the facing to the target, positive on the mob's left
//!   (the trace rule; Inferred from the Turn sub-tree's `< -30 Or > 30`).
//! - `Target_Visible`: the target is within the combat vision distance (Inferred: the retail
//!   boar turned to a player at 77 to 107 degrees, so its 180 degree combat cone does not hide
//!   the target in a fight; trace finding a).
//! - `Target_Reachable`, `Target_Directly_Reachable`: the straight line to the target stands on
//!   floor within the slice's `m_maxSlope` (Inferred: the server has no navigation mesh, see
//!   [`floor_line`]).
//! - `Time_Since_Target_Reachable`: seconds since the target was last reachable (Inferred from
//!   the name and `TargetUnreachableResetTime` 5 s).
//! - `Target_Vitals_State`, `Vitals_State`: 4 while alive (Inferred: the trees name the test
//!   `$Target_Vitals_State Equal 4` "HasAliveTarget", 154 times; a dead player is no target).
//! - `Health_Percent`: 0 to 100 (Observed: the trees compare it with 5 to 100, and 33.33 and
//!   66.67 for thirds).
//! - `Spawn_Pos`, `Last_Damage_Pos`, `Full_Body_Reaction`, `Waypoint_Pos`, `Waypoint_Duration`.
//! - `Passive`: the slice's `Is_Passive` (Inferred: the boar's `IsPassive?` branch reads
//!   `Passive`, its slice sets `Is_Passive`).
//! - Every other engine key is not set: its value is Unknown, and the trees then read their
//!   fallback or the slice config (for example `Leash_Time_Limit`: the cvar values are Unknown,
//!   so the leash takes the branch without a time limit).
