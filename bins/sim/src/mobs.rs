//! The mobs of one sim (M6-A spec section 6). A sim spawns the vitals spawns of the world file
//! that lie in its cells; a mob belongs to the sim of its spawn and never hands off, because its
//! leash keeps it near the spawn.
//!
//! Each mob's mind is the game's own (behavior-tree study 2026-09-18):
//! - a mob whose creature slice names a tree Server.pak has runs that tree
//!   ([`crate::mob_ai::TreeMind`]);
//! - the three tutorial mobs whose trees Server.pak lacks (FTUE club sailor, FTUE legionnaire,
//!   tutorial Thorpe; study section 4.1) fight with the paces measured from the retail tutorial
//!   (`nw_sim_core::ChaseBrain`, set by the tutorial's encounter script);
//! - any other mob has no tree and no measured script: it stands at its spawn (for example the
//!   beach first mate, whose `damned_firstmate_2h_anchor_basebehavior` is not in Server.pak).
//!
//! Only awake mobs think. Each tick, the mobs within the wake radius of a player wake; an awake
//! mob without a target and with no player within the wake radius for the sleep time falls
//! asleep. A grid of the spawn points, in buckets of the wake radius plus the largest leash,
//! finds the mobs near a player. A player scans again only after it moved [`WAKE_RESCAN_M`] since
//! its last scan, or when the cells change. Awake tree mobs think on the sim's tick threads.
//!
//! A personal mob (a tutorial encounter's) belongs to one player: only that player sees it and is
//! its target, it may be held idle until its fight starts, it stays awake, and it does not
//! respawn: its encounter removes it.
//!
//! A GM mob (admin studio spec section 8.2) is spawned by a game master at any point: every player
//! sees and fights it, it stays awake, and it respawns at its spawn until the GM removes it.
