//! (`PartialTaskContainer`), or all at once until all are done (`SimpleTaskContainer`). A leaf
//! task is done at once (an achievement unlock, an item removal, a game event it fires), after a

//! screen, the gather of a quest object), or while the player is so (in or out of a point of
//! interest, with an achievement). The client plays the scenes on its own when the server sets the
//! achievements of the tree.
