//! children: one after the other (`ConsecutiveTaskContainer`), all at once until one is done
//! (`PartialTaskContainer`), or all at once until all are done (`SimpleTaskContainer`). A leaf
//! task is done at once (an achievement unlock, an item removal, a game event it fires), after a
//! time (a timer), on a game event (a video, a cutscene, a kill, an area, an item, an equip, a UI
//! screen, the gather of a quest object), or while the player is so (in or out of a point of
//! interest, with an achievement). The client plays the scenes on its own when the server sets the
//! achievements of the tree.
