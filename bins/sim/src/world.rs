//! The world state of `sim` (M4 spec sections 3.1, 7.3; M5 spec sections 3.3, 3.4, 7), in a
//! `bevy_ecs` world, with no I/O: the caller passes times in and sends what a tick returns.
//!
//! Every tick, each player gets replication bundles on channel 1, unreliable, as in the captures:
//! the player's own state first, then the nearest players, mobs and ghosts inside the interest
//! radius, at most [`MAX_BUNDLE_MEMBERS`] members' bytes per bundle. Other players go by priority
//! ([`replica`]): near or fighting ones every tick, far ones less often, each state with its full
//! position, so a lost datagram costs one state. How the retail service removes an entity from a
//! client is Unknown, so a player who leaves the radius is simply not in the next bundles.
//!
//! With a cell table, a tick also starts the handoff of each player that is past the margin into
//! another sim's cells (the player is frozen until the answer), and lists the players near each
//! other sim's cells as ghosts for that sim.
