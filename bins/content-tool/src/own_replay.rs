//! Replays the client input of retail tutorial captures through the sim's own movement of the
//! player ([`nw_sim_core::TrackedBody`], with the sim's reading of each input record:
//! [`sim::camera`]) over the level's ground, and compares the body with retail's own place.
//!
//! Retail's server runs the client's own character controller, so its own place is where the
//! client stands. The client corrects its own prediction toward the server's own place when the
//! two differ by more than its correction threshold, and snaps past the full-correction distance
//! (`scripts/patch-client.py`: 0.5 m and 2.0 m in the patched client). So the share of compared
//! places past those distances is how often our server pulls the client: the rubber banding.
//!
//! Open-loop: a server move of retail (a step of more than [`SERVER_MOVE_M`] between two own
//! places) puts the body at retail's new place, as the sim does with its own moves.
