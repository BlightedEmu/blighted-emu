//! `content-tool ai-trace`: what the retail mobs of one capture ledger did, for the behavior-tree
//! AI. One trace per mob spawn lifetime: its card asset and creature slice, its vitals id, and its
//! `ALCReplicatedState` (type 11) samples in time order: state number, position, facing, the turn
//! the AI still wants, and each new FullBody scope entry by fragment and action name. Next to the
//! mobs: the own player's position track and the hits the player took.
//!
//! Labels: **Observed**, **Inferred**, **Unknown**.
//!
//! - Mob (Observed, the rule of `ftue_entities`): a bundle group whose spawn card names an asset
//!   other than the player slice and a `GdeRef`, with a vitals id in the same group. Its lifetime
//!   is one `(connection context, interest)` slot from that card until the slot is stopped by the
//!   bundle index block, another mob's card takes the slot, the connection starts again, or the
//!   level changes. Groups of the own player's interest 1 (bundle note) give only the player
//!   track: the newchar capture has a card there with an asset outside the creature table
//!   (1,041,878 ms on). A card alone is not taken: the byte-by-byte search finds lone cards in
//!   the middle of groups it cannot read (Observed: boar cards "at" interest 1).
//! - Group walk: [`BundlePayload::decode_known`] reads the members whose class `nw-messages`
//!   reads, from the payload start; a member of a class that only [`extra_members`] reads is
//!   passed with it, and the walk goes on in the same group. Where neither reads a member, the
//!   walk looks for the next group one byte at a time and takes it when its first group is whole
//!   and ends at a group boundary (the rule of `ftue_entities`, whose walker is private, so this
//!   module has its own smallest one).
//! - State number (Observed: client text "Absolute portion in delta compression"; own-player
//!   position note): `idAbs` (child 25) is the high byte, `idRel` (child 0) the low byte; a child
//!   that a state does not send keeps its last value.
//! - Position: the last `pos10` (child 27, read by [`AlcState::read`]) plus the last
//!   `worldPosRel` (child 10) offset of [`nw_messages::offset_metres`] per axis (4/255 m per step
//!   from `0x7f`, `0xff` being no offset). The rule is Observed to hold: see the player hits below.
//! - Facing (Observed, rotation note; `nw_messages::alc::rotation_bytes` re-encodes all 3,648
//!   retail values): the `rotation` quat (child 11) in smallest-three form; yaw 0 faces north
//!   (+y) and a positive yaw turns to the west (counter-clockwise seen from above).
//! - Turn wanted (Observed name, creature-animation note): `aiAngleToDesiredFacing` (child 35),
//!   a big-endian `f32` in radians; its sign convention is Unknown.
//! - FullBody entry (Inferred from `nw_messages::alc::MobAnimation`, which writes them so, and
//!   Observed to fit: in the newchar capture the entry count equals the set bits of the mask in
//!   every mob blob but 178): the `scopeInfoBlob` (child 33) holds one entry per set bit of
//!   `scopeData` (child 32), in bit order; the FullBody entry is the one of the creature's
//!   `FullBody` scope bit. For the other blobs see [`AlcTrack::full_body_entry`]. Fragment `n` is
//!   `fragments[n - 1]` and action `n` is `actions[n - 1]` of the creature row.
//! - Player position: the own player's ALC states (interest 1, component 16; payload note), by
//!   the same position rule as a mob. This is the place the retail server itself keeps for the
//!   player, so its AI measures from it. The bit-7 position of the client input (type 1589) is
//!   the third-person camera, 2.9 to 4.75 m behind the body (Observed, `bins/sim/src/camera.rs`
//!   note), so it is not used. The mob position rule matches the attacker position of all 26
//!   retail `OnDamage` hits of the newchar capture within 0.00 to 1.33 m (median 0.055 m;
//!   Observed), so the position rule above is Observed to hold, with its step Inferred.
//! - Player hits (Observed, swing note in `nw_messages::combat`): every `OnDamage` (type 3601)
//!   names the attacker's facet entity and where the attacker stood; the attacker is the mob whose
//!   card `GdeRef` has that facet entity.
