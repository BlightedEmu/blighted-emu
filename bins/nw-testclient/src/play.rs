//! `nw-testclient play`: one bot of a game master account plays quests on the live servers
//! through the calls a game client sends, and reports each quest: completed, broken (the step
//! and why), or not played (a step whose flow the bot does not play yet).
//!
//! For each quest the bot asks the sim where the quest stands (`!queststate`) and what its
//! waiting steps need (`!questplan`, `sim::world::quest_walk`). It takes the quest with the
//! client's accept (3772) and turns it in with the client's turn-in (794); it talks to NPCs with
//! a talk interaction in its input, finishes conversation topics (5397), tells the server the
//! territories it enters and leaves (2297, 6416) and sends the cinematic, cutscene, screen and
//! faction calls a client sends. It kills a step's mobs with attack inputs: the placed mobs at
//! the step's spawn when only those count (by their spawn group), else mobs of the step's type
//! that a game master spawns there. It gathers the nodes of a quest object or a gatherable that
//! gives a step's item, with a client's gather interaction. Game master lines move it (`!tp`),
//! keep it alive (`!god on`), and give it the items no gather gives (`!give`), with the source
//! the sim names.
