//! request, the end of an instance, and how many instance sims each level needs.
//!
//! A sim with the instance role runs one instance at a time (spec 4.4). The director gives a
//! group a free instance sim of the level, keeps the group's instance for re-entry (members who
//! come later, players who come back after a disconnect), and ends it when its game mode's time
//! (`OverrideDungeonTimeout`) is over or it stayed empty for the configured time. An instance
//! whose sim goes silent ends with it (spec 8: its players go back to the open map at their next
//! join). With a launch command, the director starts instance sim processes when a level has
//! fewer free ones than its spare count, and stops the ones it started that stayed free beyond
//! the spare count: 10 players need none, 10,000 players start what the requests ask for, on any
//! host that runs the command (no cloud service).
