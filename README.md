# Blighted New World Emulator

A preservation server emulator for New World: Aeternum. The official servers shut down on 2027-01-31.

- Players use their own legal copy of the final PC client. This project never distributes Amazon game files.
- The emulator runs on standard dedicated servers, with no AWS dependency.
- It is non-commercial.

Design: the architecture spec is kept locally (not in git).

## Licences

| Part | Licence |
|---|---|
| Server programs and core crates | AGPL-3.0-or-later ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) |
| `launcher` | GPL-3.0-or-later |
| `nw-formats` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `nw-oodle` | GPL-3.0-or-later |

Each crate states its licence in its `Cargo.toml`. `cargo deny check` enforces the policy in `deny.toml`.

## Requirements

- Rust (the version in `rust-toolchain.toml` is installed automatically by rustup)
- Docker with Compose v2
- `cargo install --locked cargo-deny cargo-sweep just`

## Quick start

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Edit `deploy/.env` and set new passwords. Then:

```bash
just check
just infra-up
just infra-test
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | Format, lint, test, dependency policy, script tests |
| `just size` | Prints the build folder size; fails above 10 GiB |
| `just clean-old` | Deletes build files older than 7 days |
| `just infra-up` / `just infra-down` | Starts / stops PostgreSQL, Valkey, NATS, Prometheus, Grafana |
| `just infra-test` | Infrastructure smoke test |
| `just test-infra` | Tests that need PostgreSQL, Valkey and NATS, with the login, gateway and world walk (run `just infra-up` first) |

| `just map-tiles` | Writes the open world map tiles into `local-data/content/map/` from your install |

## Content data

The server reads game rules from your own New World install. Nothing from the game is stored in this repository; only the table shapes (names and types) are generated into `crates/nw-content/src/generated`.

```bash
export NW_GAME_DIR="/path/to/steamapps/common/New World"
just bundle
just world
```

`just bundle` writes `local-data/content/bundle-<build>.bin`, then reloads it and checks every table and row. The pinned client build is in `config/client-build.toml`.

`just world` writes `local-data/content/world-<build>-<level>.bin` for each of the 41 levels (about 620 MB in all), reloads each file, and prints the record counts, the skipped metadata fields, and the spawn IDs that no datasheet row has.

### Recovery

`content-tool` links `nw-content`, so it cannot run while the generated code does not compile. Removing the `generated` module lines from `crates/nw-content/src/lib.rs` is not enough, because `bundle.rs` and `content-tool build` use `Tables`. Instead:

1. Restore the committed generated files: `git checkout -- crates/nw-content/src/generated`.
2. Fix the cause (usually a change to `bins/content-tool/src/codegen`).
3. Run `just codegen` again.

Codegen stops with an error when a table type name would give an invalid Rust name or a name that the generated code already uses, so a new client build cannot write code that does not compile for that reason.

## Capture check

`content-tool capture-check` reads capture ledgers (`ledger.bin`, decrypted carrier datagrams) with `nw-capture`, decodes them with `nw-carrier` and `nw-reflect`, and prints counts only: datagrams, messages per type index, registration response values, and decode failures. It exits with an error when any datagram or message does not decode. It also decodes the server messages of the M4 types and the client input (type 1589) with `nw-messages`, encodes them again, and counts those that give the same bytes; a difference is a failure. Inside each replication bundle it does the same for the members at the front of the payload whose class has a reader (types 10, 11, 13 and 15; type 11 is kept as its bytes and its position). The facts it checks are in `docs/re/2026-09-02-carrier-captures.md`.

`content-tool combat-check` checks the combat data of `sim` (M6-A spec section 11.2) without the install: every vitals spawn of a level (default `newworld_vitaeeterna`) must find its mob type and level rows, and the mob max health of each creature record saved from nwdb.info (`--nwdb-dir`, default `local-data/nwdb.info/records/creature`) is compared with ours. A health matches within a thousandth; a health that matches ours at another level is counted apart. It prints counts and datasheet ids only.

Ledgers hold data of other players. Keep them in git-ignored `local-data/captures/`; never commit them or paste message contents.

```bash
export NW_GAME_DIR="/path/to/steamapps/common/New World"
just capture-check
```

To print class names next to type indexes, add `--names local-data/Aeternum-World-main/Catalog/uuid_to_class.json` (Aeternum-World, AGPL-3.0); the tool joins it to `typeindex.json` in your install by UUID.

## Login server and launcher

`edge-http` is the HTTPS login server. Players log in with the `launcher` program, by username and password or with Discord (one mode per server, `[auth] mode` in `config/edge.toml`).

The server needs a domain name of your own with two host names that point to the server:

- `login.<domain>`: the launcher API and the channel document that the game downloads first.
- `game.<domain>`: the game routes. Every game request carries the game session key in its path (`/s/<session>/...`).

Get one normal public certificate that covers both names (for example from Let's Encrypt with `certbot` or `lego`). The DNS challenge works also when the names point to a LAN address. Put the PEM files where `[tls]` points. The game always uses port 443, so `https_listen` must use port 443. On Linux, give the program that right once after each build: `sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' target/debug/edge-http`.

Secrets come from environment variables, never from the config file:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NW_SECRET_SIGNING_KEY` | Entry ticket key: `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `NW_SECRET_GLOBAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Password of `[global_database]` |
| `NW_SECRET_WORLD_1_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Password of the first world database (the name is set by `database_password_env`) |
| `NW_SECRET_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` | Discord client secret, Discord mode only |

```bash
cargo run -p edge-http -- migrate   # creates missing databases and applies migrations
cargo run -p edge-http -- serve
cargo run -p launcher
```

In Discord mode, add `https://login.<domain>/launcher/discord/callback` as a redirect URL of your Discord application.

`edge-http` logs every request that no route serves (`request for an unknown route`, with the session key masked). These lines show what the client asks for that the server does not answer yet.

### M2 exit test (manual)

Do this once in password mode and once in Discord mode (`[auth] mode`).

1. Start the services (`just infra-up`), set the secrets, then run `edge-http migrate` and `edge-http serve`.
2. Start Steam. Start the launcher, type your domain, and log in (or make an account).
3. Click Play. The game starts through Steam with `-ChannelService https://login.<domain>`, `-LoginChannelOverride <game session key>` and `-AuthBackend nw`. The last one makes the game send its Steam ticket to our `/steam` route; in `Game.log`, `Persona failed to initialize!` or `Omni metadata is NOT present` means the game took another auth path.
4. The game must reach the character select screen. Make a character.
5. Close the game. Click Play again. The new character must be in the list.
6. Save the `Game.log` lines of the login steps and the `edge-http` log lines of the run in a new note in `docs/re/` as evidence. Remove your account name, Steam ids and IP addresses first.

If the game stops before character select, keep the `Game.log` lines and the `request for an unknown route` lines: they show the next step to build.

## World gateway and test client

`rep-gateway` is the UDP entry point of a world. The game connects to the `rep_address` in `config/edge.toml` after the login queue. The gateway runs DTLS 1.2 and the GridMate carrier, checks the entry ticket in the registration message, answers with a status, and keeps the connection alive with pings. Each ticket works one time only.

`nw-testclient` does what the game does up to that point: it logs in over HTTPS, makes a character when the account has none, waits in the queue, and registers with the gateway.

The game itself cannot connect to the gateway. It trusts only one certificate that is built into the game, and this project does not change that. The test client trusts the gateway's own certificate instead.

Set up the gateway once:

1. In `config/rep-gateway.toml`, set `world_id` to the `[[world]] id` in `config/edge.toml`. The `rep_address` in `config/edge.toml` must reach `udp_listen` (the example files match).
2. Make the gateway's certificate and key. The files go to `local-data/rep-gateway/` and are never replaced:

```bash
cargo run -p rep-gateway -- generate-certificate
```

Secrets come from environment variables:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NW_SECRET_SIGNING_KEY` | The same entry ticket key as `edge-http` |
| `NW_SECRET_TESTCLIENT_PASSWORD` | Password of the test account (`nw-testclient` only) |

```bash
cargo run -p rep-gateway -- serve
cargo run -p nw-testclient
```

`nw-testclient` reads `config/nw-testclient.toml`. Set `login_url` and `game_url` to your domain. The account is made on the first run.

The gateway serves Prometheus metrics on `metrics_listen` (`rep_gateway_*`, among them datagrams and UDP payload bytes in and out). Keep that address internal.

### M3 exit test

1. `cargo test --workspace` passes.
2. `just capture-check` reads every local ledger with 0 decode errors.
3. Start the services (`just infra-up`), set the secrets, then start `edge-http serve` and `rep-gateway serve`.
4. Run `cargo run -p nw-testclient`. It must print `registration status 0`, then about 60 echoed pings (at least half of one per second of hold) with `closed by server: false`, then a non-zero status for the second registration with the same ticket. The exit code must be 0.

`just test-infra` runs the same walk without the network: the test client logs in through the `edge-http` routes on the Docker PostgreSQL and Valkey, then registers with a gateway on a loopback port.

## World simulation

The open map (`newworld_vitaeeterna`) runs on one or more `sim` processes at 30 ticks per second. `world-director` cuts the map into square cells of `cell_size_m` and gives each live `sim` a stripe of cell columns. Every second it publishes this cell table, and it writes the free player slots of the world to Valkey; the login queue admits players only while there are free slots.

After the gateway checks a ticket, it asks the director to place the character. The director loads the saved position (or, the first time, the next of its `start_positions` in turn, on the ground of the world file), takes a new entity number, and asks the `sim` that owns that cell to take the player. The `sim` sends the login messages. Only then does the gateway send registration status 0.

Every tick, each player gets its own position and the nearest `max_visible_players` players inside `interest_radius_m`, also players of other `sim` processes near a border (ghosts). A client moves by sending its input (type 1589); the `sim` checks the position: finite, inside the level, not faster than `run_speed_mps` x (1 + `speed_margin`) over a budget of `burst_seconds`, and not under the ground or more than `max_height_above_ground_m` above it. A refused move keeps the last good position, which the player's next bundle shows.

A player who walks `handoff_margin_m` into a cell of another `sim` moves to that `sim` (handoff). The player keeps its entity number and does not notice. The gateway sends the player's input to the new `sim` from then on. When a `sim` stops, the director gives its cells to the others; its players stay connected and continue on another `sim` at their last saved position. A `sim` that keeps sending for a connection that the gateway routes to another `sim` for more than 2 s is told to drop that player. Each `sim` saves every player every `save_interval_ms` and when the player leaves; each save carries the time of the player's last accepted move, and the database keeps only the newest.

When no `sim` heartbeat reaches the director for a whole silence window, the director most likely lost its own NATS link: it keeps its table, and the players continue. So a world whose every `sim` stops at once waits until a `sim` comes back.

NATS carries the messages between the gateway, the director and the `sim` processes. NATS has no login in this setup, so keep it on an internal address.

Set up once:

1. Build the world files from your install: `just bundle`, then `just world`. The director reads the ground height for `start_positions`; each `sim` reads it for the move checks.
2. `world_id` in `config/world-director.toml`, `config/sim.toml` and `config/rep-gateway.toml` must be the `[[world]] id` in `config/edge.toml` (the example files match).
3. Run the world database migrations with `edge-http migrate` after an update (M5 adds the entity numbers).

Secrets:

| Variable | Value |
|---|---|
| `NW_SECRET_WORLD_1_DATABASE_PASSWORD` | Password of the world database (the director and `sim` use the variable named by `world_database_password_env`) |
| `NW_SECRET_TESTCLIENT_PASSWORD_B` | Password of the second test account (`nw-testclient pair` only) |
| `NW_SECRET_TESTCLIENT_SWARM_PASSWORD` | Password of every bot account (`nw-testclient swarm` and `hunt` only) |

Start the director, then the `sim` processes, then the gateway. Each `sim` needs its own `sim_id` and `metrics_listen`; override them with environment variables:

```bash
cargo run -p world-director
NW_SIM_SIM_ID=sim-1 NW_SIM_METRICS_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:9102 cargo run -p sim
NW_SIM_SIM_ID=sim-2 NW_SIM_METRICS_LISTEN=127.0.0.1:9104 cargo run -p sim
cargo run -p rep-gateway -- serve
cargo run -p nw-testclient -- pair
```

The director logs the x range of each `sim` (`cells assigned`). The same ids always give the same stripes.

`nw-testclient pair` logs in two accounts (`account` and `second_account`) and keeps both in the world for `hold_seconds`. Each client must see the other. The first walks `route_m` (points east and north of where it stands) at `route_speed_mps`, and the second must see it on the route within `path_tolerance_m`. Then the first sends one move `jump_m` east, which `sim` must refuse. Then the first account logs in again and must appear at its saved position, within `position_tolerance_m`. It prints `pass` or `FAIL` for each check, and the exit code is 0 only when every check passed. `hold_seconds` must be longer than the walk.

`nw-testclient swarm` runs `[swarm] bots` bots (`--bots <n>` sets another count). Each bot takes the entry of `starts_m` nearest to where it appears, walks to its own lane north or south of that start, then east and west across the line through it for `duration_seconds`, on the ground of the world file. Set `starts_m` to the director's `start_positions` and put each on a `sim` border, so every crossing is a handoff. It checks that every bot registered, crossed its line at least `min_crossings` times, stayed on its route, was not closed, got its bundles with no gap above `max_bundle_gap_ms`, and got at least 99 % of its bundles (one per tick). From the metrics of every `sim` in `metrics_urls` it checks the handoffs (enough, none refused or late), that no move was refused, that 99 % of the handoffs and of the ticks took at most one tick (33 ms), and that every metrics page was read. It also prints the PC's UDP receive buffer errors of the step. With `duration_seconds = 0` (also in `[hunt]`), the bots stay until Ctrl-C or until standard input reaches its end, then every bot closes and the report is printed.

For many players on one PC (M5 load spec): give the gateway one `workers` per core you can spare (they share `udp_listen`), keep `udp_buffer_bytes` at 4 MiB (Linux caps it at `net.core.rmem_max`), and set `tick_threads` of each `sim` so that the sims together do not ask for more cores than the PC has.

The bots register their accounts on the first run. `edge-http` counts every registration per IP address against `auth.login_fail_limit`, so raise it for that run, for example `NW_EDGE_AUTH__LOGIN_FAIL_LIMIT=5000`. The gateway counts new connections per IP address too: raise `limits.handshakes_per_ip_per_second` (for example `NW_GATEWAY_LIMITS__HANDSHAKES_PER_IP_PER_SECOND=200`).

The director serves Prometheus metrics on `metrics_listen` (`director_*`), each `sim` on its own (`sim_*`, among them `sim_bundle_members_total`: the members put in bundles). Keep those addresses internal. With `[admin] snapshot_interval_ms` above 0 (at least 100; 0 is off and the committed value), each `sim` publishes a snapshot of its players and awake mobs on `sim.<id>.snapshot` for the admin live panel, and times it in `sim_snapshot_seconds`.

Known gaps:

- `sim` does not send the messages whose layout is still open: types 1628, 3236, 1635 and 6310.
- `sim` reads only the position of the client input. What the other fields of type 1589 mean is mostly Unknown; they are kept as raw bytes.
- The client's reaction to a refused move, and to the jump back of a resumed player, is Unknown: `sim` only sends positions in the player's bundles.
- The speed limit allows sprint with the road boost (6.3 m/s), not mounts or speed effects: `sim` has neither yet.
- How the retail server removes an entity from a client is Unknown. A player who leaves the interest radius is not in the next bundles.
- The retail interest range and limit on visible players are Unknown; `interest_radius_m` and `max_visible_players` are our own choices.
- Cells are shared by count, not by player load. There are no instance `sim` processes yet. `edge-http` gives one `rep_address`.

### M4 exit test

1. `cargo test --workspace` and `just test-infra` pass.
2. `just capture-check` reads every local ledger with 0 decode errors.
3. Start the services (`just infra-up`), set the secrets, then start `edge-http serve`, `world-director`, `sim`, and `rep-gateway serve`.
4. Run `cargo run -p nw-testclient -- pair`. Every check must print `pass`, and the exit code must be 0.

`just test-infra` runs the same pair check without the network, on the Docker PostgreSQL, Valkey and NATS, with a level without height data and two `sim` processes; the walk crosses their border and back. It also writes a saved position to the database and checks that the next login appears there, and it stops one `sim` while a client is on it. On the real level, the walk of `pair` must stay inside the ground band: keep `route_m` short and on flat ground near the start position.

### M5 load test

1. Start `edge-http serve`, `world-director` with `cell_size_m = 1024` and a list of `start_positions` on the `sim` borders, eight `sim` processes, and `rep-gateway serve` with several `workers`, all release builds.
   The gateway refuses connections above `limits.max_connections` (2,000 in the committed config). Raise it above the largest step, for example `NW_GATEWAY_LIMITS__MAX_CONNECTIONS=12000`.
2. Run `nw-testclient swarm --bots 1000`, then 2,500, 5,000 and 10,000, with `mpstat 5` beside it. A step passes when every check prints `pass`. A step that fails while the PC has less than 5 % idle CPU shows the limit of the PC.

### M5 exit test

1. `cargo test --workspace` and `just test-infra` pass.
2. Start the services, set the secrets, then start `edge-http serve`, `world-director`, four `sim` processes, and `rep-gateway serve` on one PC, with the director's `start_positions` on a `sim` border.
3. `cargo run -p nw-testclient -- pair` passes every check.
4. `cargo run -p nw-testclient -- swarm` with 1,000 bots and the `metrics_urls` of the four `sim` processes passes every check.

## Mobs and combat (M6-A, M6-B)

Each `sim` loads the content bundle at start (`content_dir`, the pinned build), keeps only the combat rows, and spawns the vitals spawns of the world file that lie in its cells. Each mob belongs to the `sim` of its spawn. A mob sleeps until a player comes within `wake_radius_m` (default: `interest_radius_m`). Then it wanders, chases a player in sight, attacks in reach, walks back to its spawn when its target is out of the leash circle (and heals there), and respawns after `mob_respawn_ms` when it dies. Mob health and damage come from `VitalsLevelData` (by level) times the mob type's mods and the category mods of its creature type (`VitalsModifierData`).

Players have health (the `Player` row of `VitalsBaseData`). A mob that kills a player makes it dead: it cannot move or attack, and the character is saved at once. When its client sends a respawn request (type 1938) at least `min_respawn_ms` after the death, it lives again with full health where it died. A handoff keeps the player's health. Awake mobs near a border are ghosts in the next `sim`; a hit on a ghost goes to the owner `sim` as a bus message.

Combat on the wire (M6-B): a mob that comes into a player's view is sent once with its spawn card (type 10) and vitals block (type 15), then its position. An input record that sets an attack bit (9, 10, 13 or 15) the record before it did not set attacks the nearest living mob in reach with the first weapon attack. The attacker gets a 2071 for each hit it makes, a player hit by a mob gets a 3601, and a killed player gets a 4299. The numbers marked Unknown in `config/sim.toml` section `[combat]` are not in the game files or the captures.

Checks:

- `content-tool combat-check` (local data, see Capture check): every spawn finds its rows, and our mob health is compared with nwdb.info.
- The fight stress test: `cargo test --release -p sim fight_stress -- --ignored --nocapture` (1,000 players each fighting one mob in one `sim`; tick p99 under 33 ms).
- `nw-testclient hunt` runs `[hunt] bots` bots (`--bots <n>` sets another count) with the accounts, walking speed and ground of `[swarm]`. Each bot walks to the nearest mob it sees (with none in view, to its own point on an 8 m ring around entry `n` modulo the count of `starts_m`; at most 30 bots per start, because each player sees its 47 nearest entities, bots and mobs together), stops within `reach_m`, and attacks every `attack_interval_ms`. After a 4299 it waits `respawn_wait_ms`, sends a 1938, and steps 1 m to show that it lives again. It checks that every bot registered, was not closed, hit a mob (a 2071), lived again after each request, and got its bundles with no gap above `max_bundle_gap_ms`; from the metrics of every `sim` in `metrics_urls`, that at least one mob died per 10 bots, that no move of a living player was refused (a move that arrives after a death, before the bot has its 4299, is counted apart), that 99 % of the ticks took at most one tick, and that every metrics page was read.

## Admin tools

### World map tiles

`content-tool map-tiles` reads the world map tiles of a level from your install (`lyshineui/worldtiles/<level>/map_l{L}_y{Y}_x{X}.dds`, default level `newworld_vitaeeterna`), decodes them (BC1 and BC3 in the pinned client), and writes `local-data/content/map/<level>/<L>/<row>_<column>.png` with an index `tiles.json`. Level 1 tiles are 256 m; each level above halves the grid (8 levels). A tile row counts from the south edge (`--y-index south-up`, the default): joined that way, the tiles of one level form the whole continent. The Oodle decoder cannot read 2 of the 3,031 tiles of the pinned client; the tool lists them and leaves them out. The tiles are game data: they stay in git-ignored `local-data/`, and `scripts/no-game-data.sh` refuses `*.dds` files.

```bash
export NW_GAME_DIR="/path/to/steamapps/common/New World"
just map-tiles
```

### blighted-admin

`blighted-admin serve` serves the admin pages on `http://127.0.0.1:9180/` (`config/blighted-admin.toml`, overrides `BLIGHTED_ADMIN_<KEY>`). It reads the world file and the content bundle from `just world` and `just bundle`, and the map tiles from `just map-tiles` when they exist; without them the map shows only the height relief. It listens on a loopback address only, because the tools have no login. A request other than `GET` needs the header `X-Blighted-Admin: 1` and, when the browser sends an `Origin`, the origin of the admin pages; so another web site in your browser cannot use it.

```bash
cargo run --release -p blighted-admin -- serve
```

For the capture viewer it lists every `ledger.bin` under `local-data/captures/` with the name of its `metadata.json` and, for an open-world session, the title of the saved Discord post that holds its archive. Message type names come from the install's `typeindex.json` joined with the Aeternum-World names (set `NW_GAME_DIR`), then from the local Azoth catalog archive (`local-data/azoth-catalog/types.json`, saved by its `archive.py` from their public API).

The capture viewer page (`/web/captures.html`) opens a session and shows its totals, the message types (with names, Azoth catalog status, counts and rates; a click draws the count per second), the entities with their paths on the map, the player's own path, a time slider, the messages near the slider time, the bytes of a message with its bundle members marked, the member classes where the bundle walks stop (the readers still missing), and a type rate comparison with a second session. Capture data stays on this PC: the pages run on a loopback address and keep nothing.

`nw-testclient --ledger <file> <command>` writes the plain carrier datagrams of its first client (received after DTLS decryption, sent before DTLS encryption) as a capture ledger. Put it under `local-data/captures/` and the capture viewer opens it like a recorded session, so a session with our servers can be compared with one of the real game. The ledger holds the login token of the test account's registration: keep it in `local-data/`. `.gitignore` ignores every `ledger.bin`, and `scripts/no-game-data.sh` refuses any tracked file named `ledger.bin` or starting with `NWDL`.

The world map page (`/web/map.html`) shows the map tiles, the relief, or the relief over the tiles at half strength (the check that both line up), and, closer than 4 m per pixel, the mob spawns, gatherables and landmarks of the world file. The page code is plain JavaScript modules built into the program; `just test-web` runs their tests with Node's built-in test runner.

### Live panel

The live page (`/live`) shows the running servers: tiles (sims, players, bots, CPU per program, tick time per sim, packets and bandwidth of the gateway, bundle members, awake and asleep mobs), the map with the sim cells, the players and the awake mobs, the player list, the selected entity, the event log, and buttons that start bot batches of 1, 10, 100 or 1,000 (`nw-testclient swarm` until stopped, one batch after another) and stop them. It reads the bus (`[live] nats_url`, the heartbeats, the cell table and the sim snapshots), the metrics pages in `[live] metrics_urls`, and `/proc` for CPU (Linux only). Bot batches take the `NW_SECRET_*` lines of `[live] testclient_env_file`; the page sends only a size and a batch number. A sim publishes snapshots only with `[admin] snapshot_interval_ms` above 0.

`just live <sims>` starts a whole local test world for it (edge-http on port 8443, the director, 1 to 8 sims with snapshots every 250 ms, the gateway) and then the panel; Ctrl-C stops all of them. Build with `cargo build --release` and set `NW_GAME_DIR` first. `LIVE_STACK_SNAPSHOT_MS=0 just live 8` runs it with snapshots off, to compare tick times. The exit test is in `docs/re/2026-09-06-admin-live-panel.md`.

## Rules for contributors

- Never commit game files, captures, or `deploy/.env`. Put local game data in `local-data/` (ignored by git).
- Never connect a changed client to Amazon's servers.
- Every new copyleft crate must be added to `[licenses] exceptions` in `deny.toml`.
