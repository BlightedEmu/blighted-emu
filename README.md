# Blighted New World Emulator

A preservation server emulator for New World: Aeternum. The official servers shut down on 2027-01-31.

- Players use their own legal copy of the final PC client. This project never distributes Amazon game files.
- The emulator runs on standard dedicated servers, with no AWS dependency.
- It is non-commercial.

Design: the architecture spec is kept locally (not in git).

## Licences

| Part | Licence |
|---|---|
| Server programs and core crates | AGPL-3.0-or-later ([LICENSE](LICENSE)) |
| `launcher` | GPL-3.0-or-later |
| `nw-formats` | MIT OR Apache-2.0 |
| `nw-oodle` | GPL-3.0-or-later |

Each crate states its licence in its `Cargo.toml`. `cargo deny check` enforces the policy in `deny.toml`.

## Requirements

- Rust (the version in `rust-toolchain.toml` is installed automatically by rustup)
- Docker with Compose v2
- `cargo install --locked cargo-deny cargo-sweep just`

## Quick start

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
```

Edit `deploy/.env` and set new passwords. Then:

```bash
just check
just infra-up
just infra-test
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `just check` | Format, lint, test, dependency policy, script tests |
| `just size` | Prints the build folder size; fails above 10 GiB |
| `just clean-old` | Deletes build files older than 7 days |
| `just infra-up` / `just infra-down` | Starts / stops PostgreSQL, Valkey, NATS, Prometheus, Grafana |
| `just infra-test` | Infrastructure smoke test |

## Rules for contributors

- Never commit game files, captures, or `deploy/.env`. Put local game data in `local-data/` (ignored by git).
- Never connect a changed client to Amazon's servers.
- Every new copyleft crate must be added to `[licenses] exceptions` in `deny.toml`.
