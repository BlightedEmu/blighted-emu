//! The server's own movement of a player's character, from the keys and the camera yaw of each
//! client input record (movement study 2026-09-20). The client never sends where its character
//! stands; retail's server moves it itself: the own place of state `n` is the place of state
//! `n - 1` moved by input record `n` (in the newchar capture the motion of a new key showed in
//! the place of the record that held it, 30 of 41 key starts).
//!
//! The direction follows the keys and the camera yaw at once (a first diagonal record already
//! moved at 45° at full speed); the speed ramps at the action lists' rates. Up and down follow the
//! floor under the body (the ground's: the terrain and the level's structures, decks, roofs,
//! stairs: [`crate::LevelGround`]), and the speed is along it (retail ran 5.50 m/s along slopes,
//! median of 33 steady windows, and less over the ground). A body walks off an edge and falls to
//! the floor below, and a floor too high to step onto is an obstacle it does not climb. A wall
//! stops the body only where a solid still stands at the step-up's highest detection height
//! ([`WALL_HEIGHT_M`]) and the body slides along it: a replay of the retail tutorial that stopped
//! the body at the level's solids a step above its feet erred by a median 0.73 m against 0.22 m
//! without (the client's capsule steps onto and slides over low rocks and rails), and with no
//! wall at all run 15 (2026-09-22) walked the body into the 4 m block under the tutorial
//! beach's stair landing, where its client was pushed into the solid and stuck.
//!
//! The movement modes (movement modes study 2026-09-20, `local-data/scratch-work/movemodes`):
//! - The posture: the crouch and prone toggles (`playeractions_postureinput.actionlist`
//!   `ToggleCrouch`, `ToggleProne`) switch between standing, crouching and lying prone, and the
//!   posture picks the action lists' speed rows (`Crouch`, `Prone`, `Crouch_Walk`, `Prone_Walk`).
//! - The walk key, held: the slow walk.
//!   A posture change holds the body for its transition fragment's time while it slows.
//! - Wading: a body on a floor whose feet are deep enough under the local water (the sea, a
//!   lake, a river: [`Ground::water_surface`]) moves at the `Wade` rows. No jump starts in water
//!   that deep, wading or swimming (`playeractions_traversal.actionlist` `Jump`, `Jump_Diagonal`,
//!   `Standing_Jump`: `Not IfWaterDepth GreaterThanOrEqual Shallow`; run 15: a jump key while
//!   swimming threw the body 0.9 m out of the sea).
//! - The road boost: sprinting on a road for long enough adds the `Traversal_RoadSprintBoost_Haste`
//!   status's `SprintSpeedMod` to the sprint speed; combat on the road ends it.
//! - The land dodge: a dodge press on a floor moves the body by the root motion of the dodge clip
//!   of its equip load class ([`EquipLoad`]); an overburdened body neither dodges nor sprints.
