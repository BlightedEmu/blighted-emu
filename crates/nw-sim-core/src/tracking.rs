//! A player's body as the server keeps it: moved by its keys ([`crate::character`]) over the
//! level's floors, and held to the client's own view ([`crate::camera_check`]) on the ground
//! plane.
//!
//! The rule, per input record: the character moves; the camera check solves where the client's
//! camera puts the body; on the ground plane the body goes toward where the camera puts it, at
//! most [`FOLLOW_STEP_M`] in one record (a wall stopped the client, a dodge or an attack moved
//! it, the server's speed was not the client's). The client moves its own player, and every
//! difference the server keeps pulls the client back. The replay of the retail tutorial captures
//! against retail's own places (`content-tool` test `own_replay`, 2026-09-24) measured it: with a
//! pull past 0.15 m by half the distance and at most 0.15 m a record, the client would have been
//! corrected (past 0.5 m) in 40% of the open-world states, with this follow in 36%, and the open
//! world's errors were 0.31 and 2.51 m (median, 90th percentile) against 0.25 and 1.71 m. A full
//! snap in one record stepped the sent place by 0.5 to 0.8 m (live 2026-09-22, the tutorial
//! ship), which the client showed as judder. When that pulls the body back against its motion,
//! the character's speed drops to the camera body's own speed along it since the record before (a
//! client held at a wall stays there instead of being pulled back record after record; replay of
//! the newchar capture, 2026-09-20: 1,366 pull-backs instead of 1,486 in the tutorial and 1,610
//! instead of 1,945 in the open world, a median of 0.34 m instead of 0.29 m in the tutorial and
//! 0.16 m instead of 0.14 m in the open world).
//!
//! The height is the level's floor, not the camera's. The ground knows the level's floors: the
//! terrain and the structures of the level collision file (`crate::LevelGround`; the tutorial deck
//! at the retail own place, 89.38 m at the start). Out of a jump, the camera's height only picks
//! which floor under the body the client stands on: the highest one at most a step-up detection
//! height above the higher of the camera's body and the body
//! ([`nw_world::collision_index::FLOOR_SEARCH_ABOVE_M`]; in an action the camera's body went
//! 1.5 m under the tutorial deck, run 19, and a search from it missed the deck); the
//! deck and not the sea under it, a building's upper floor and not its cellar. A camera's height
//! errs by up to half a metre, the floors of one place lie metres apart. A body that falls lands
//! on that floor once it is down at it. Where the level has neither height data nor a structure
//! the body takes the camera's height. So does a body whose camera stands more than
//! [`CAMERA_FLOOR_SPREAD_M`] above the highest floor the level knows there while it sinks no
//! faster than a walk down the steepest walkable slope: it stands on a floor the level lacks (the
//! steps of the tutorial cave, run 17: the level collision has no surface between 23.13 m and
//! 33 m there, and the body stayed at the foot while the client climbed); in an action it keeps
//! its own height there, as the camera's height is off in an action. A body the server dropped
//! (a move into the air) falls by the physics until it lands.
//!
//! The camera does not carry the body through a wall ([`wall_between`]) from close by: the
//! client's capsule does not pass one, so a camera body just beyond it is the solve's error, a
//! boom the level shortened (run 15: by the beach stairs the camera's body stood 1.2 m from the
//! camera and resyncs of 0.7 to 1.3 m carried the body into the solid block under the stair
//! landing). The wall is the one at the higher body's feet, so a client that climbed onto a ledge
//! takes the body along. From farther than [`WALL_HOLD_M`], a camera's body that stands in the
//! open on the far side (the way back to the body meets the wall too) shows a client that went
//! around or over the wall where the level's collision differs from the client's, and the camera
//! carries the body again: in the tutorial replay a wall held the body behind the beach block for
//! the rest of the run, 127 m from retail's place (median); with this limit 0.40 m (1.5 m and 3 m
//! gave the same within 0.03 m). A camera's body inside a solid (the way back enters no wall)
//! never carries it, from any distance (run 15's stayed in the block for a second).
//!
//! A camera does not give the body's height itself: the boom is never sent, the camera check
//! measures it from the server's own motion of the body while the view turns, and an action
//! moves the body by its animation, which the solve reads as a change of the boom. Run 14
//! (2026-09-20), the first sailor fight on the tutorial deck: in a fast turn of the view the
//! solve's boom grew from 4.4 to 5.25 m without a boom key, the camera's body went 0.55 m under
//! the deck, and a body that took the camera's height went down through the deck, 89.39 to 82.1 m
//! in two seconds. The client's camera also shortens its boom where it meets the level
//! (`libs/camera/gamecamera.xml`: `CameraCollides`); on the retail tutorial deck the camera's body
//! stood 0.48 m below to 0.73 m above the retail own place while moving (5% to 95%). Replay of
//! the retail newchar tutorial with the level collision (level-collision note 2026-09-20): the
//! body's height erred by a median 0.022 m and 0.117 m at the 90th percentile, against 0.124 m and
//! 0.654 m with the camera's height. In a jump the body keeps its own height and the camera moves
//! it only on the ground plane (a jump that dropped the camera's pull-back went on 0.58 m beside
//! retail's place over the Fury Bay ledge gap, open-world replay records 25,304 to 25,321). A record whose camera does not follow the body changes
//! nothing.
