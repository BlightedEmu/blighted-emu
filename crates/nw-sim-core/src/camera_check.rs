//! Where the client's camera says the body is (movement study 2026-09-20). The server stands the
//! character on the level's floors but does not stop it at walls ([`crate::character`]), so the
//! character it moves from the keys walks through walls the client stops at; the camera of each
//! input record is the client's own view and shows where the client's body really is.
//!
//! Retail's third-person camera sits on a boom behind the body: the body is the camera moved
//! along the view by the boom (horizontally `boom × cos(pitch)`), 0.50 m to the left of the
//! camera, and `1.685 m + boom × sin(pitch)` below it, and while the body moves the camera trails
//! it by 0.06 s of its motion. The boom is the client's zoom (3 to 7 m at rest, 2.75 m for the
//! short boom, shorter where the camera meets a wall) and is never sent, so each camera gives the
//! body only up to the boom. The check keeps the boom:
//!
//! - While the body rests, the camera moves around a still body (a zoom, a turn of the view). When
//!   the last records' views turn by at least [`ORBIT_TURN_RAD`], their cameras alone give the
//!   body and the boom (weighted least squares): the camera turns around the client's body, not
//!   the server's (live run fishing-01, 2026-09-26: the camera orbited a body 7.4 m along the
//!   view, 1.2 m from the risen it hit, while the server's body, held at its own place, stood
//!   3 m nearer the camera and every swing missed). Otherwise the boom is the distance of the
//!   body along the view. When the body comes to rest, a boom within half a zoom step of a zoom
//!   length is that length, and the body is where it puts it (retail's resting booms are the zoom
//!   lengths to 0.01 m unless a wall shortens them).
//! - While the body moves, the boom keeps its length unless a boom key was pressed: the boom is
//!   solved by weighted least squares over the last records' cameras and the server's own motion
//!   between them, with a prior on the boom and a weak one on the server's body (a turning view
//!   shows the boom; a straight view leaves it as it was). The body is where the newest camera
//!   puts it with that boom.
//!
//! A camera that does not fit the solve or puts the boom out of its range (a cutscene camera, a
//! camera the client moved away, a server move not yet followed) gives nothing.
