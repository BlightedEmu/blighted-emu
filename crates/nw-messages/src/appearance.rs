//! `MB::PlayerAppearanceComponentReplicatedState` (type 1195, player component 12) on the bundle
//! path (player-appearance note). The class has slot 0 only. Its constructor registers 14
//! children: twelve one-byte look choices (gender, race, skin tone, hairstyle, facial hair, hair
//! colour, facial hair colour, eye colour, face mark, scar, tattoo, tattoo colour), then
//! `iconData` (`PlayerIconData`: 7 bytes and a big-endian `u16`) and `appearanceChangeFlag` (one
//! byte). Each look byte is a position in a list of the client's character-creation data. Every
//! retail first body of the local player sets all 14 children (25 bytes).
