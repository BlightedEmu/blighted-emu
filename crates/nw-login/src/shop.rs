//! The shop and entitlement services (study note `docs/re/2026-11-02-shop-services.md`). The
//! client's `FcsEndpointClient` (`FUN_1416190f0`) calls them at the hosts of the remote config
//! keys `omni.fcs.endpoints.*`, which this server fills with `game.<domain>`
//! ([`crate::remote_config::GAME_HOST_ENDPOINTS`]). Without the keys the client calls Amazon.
//!
//! While `[shop] enabled` is on, the catalog offers every mount and every token pack (the
//! barbershop token) of the store table ([`nw_protocol::store_api`]): for 0 Marks of Fortune while
//! `[shop] free` is on (retail's last weeks, `mount-menu-buying-all-store-horses`, 2026-11-04),
//! else for its price. The entitlement list holds what every account holds (the expansion), the
//! account's wallet, what the account got and its consumables with their counts (global
//! database). A purchase goes to the sim over the game connection (898), not to these
//! routes. An offer's alias is its mount's store product, every store is hidden with one empty
//! slot, and a sync is accepted. The shapes, the `ETag` and the `304` follow the retail replies
//! (`Loadouts` capture: 368 offers, 69 of them mounts).
//!
//! The persona of a path is the player's account id (`PersonaId` of the login). Inferred: the
//! client sends no proof of its account to these routes that this server checks, so the
//! entitlement list of an account answers whoever names its id; it holds only store mounts.
