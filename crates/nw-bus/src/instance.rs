//! The bus of the instances (expeditions, raids, trials; architecture spec sections 4.4 and
//! 4.5): a sim with the instance role runs one instance at a time; the director gives a group an
//! instance sim on demand, keeps the group's instance for re-entry, and ends it.
//!
//! - The open-world sim of a player who activates an instance asks the director
//!   ([`InstanceRequest`] on [`crate::subject::director_instance`], request/reply).
//! - The director asks the social service for the requester's group ([`GroupQuery`] on
//!   [`crate::subject::social_group`], request/reply), then opens the instance on a free
//!   instance sim of the level ([`InstanceCommand::Open`] on [`crate::subject::sim_instance`],
//!   request/reply) or finds the group's open one, and answers [`InstanceReply`].
//! - The players move with the handoff path (`HandoffOffer` with `enter_level`) to the instance
//!   sim and back.
//! - Each instance sim reports its instance in its heartbeat ([`InstanceBeat`]); the director
//!   ends an instance that ran out of time or stayed empty ([`InstanceCommand::Close`]).
