//! The bus between the sims and the world's social service (run 15 social study): chat, players,
//! groups, companies and voice-chat setup are one state per world, so a player's friends, group
//! and company reach it on any sim.
//!
//! - Each sim sends its players' social calls and their presence ([`SocialBatch`] on
//!   [`crate::subject::social_input`]) once per tick.
//! - The service sends each sim the messages for its players ([`SocialDeliveries`] on
//!   [`crate::subject::sim_social`]); the sim puts the facet header in front and sends them to
//!   their clients.
//! - The service also sends each sim the replicated social states of its players
//!   ([`OwnStateDelivery`]: groups, friends and blocks, company, chat mutes) and the state of
//!   each player's group entity ([`GroupEntityDelivery`]); the sim puts them into the player's
//!   next bundle.
//! - The treasury moves a player's coins through the sim that has the player ([`CoinTransfer`]
//!   on [`crate::subject::sim_coins`], request/reply).
