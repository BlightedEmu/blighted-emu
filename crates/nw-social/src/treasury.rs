//! The company treasury. A transfer moves coins in two steps: through the player's sim
//! ([`Effect::MoveCoins`]) and in the database ([`Effect::Treasury`]); coins never exist in
//! neither place without a record of them.
//!
//! - A deposit takes the coins from the player first, then adds them to the treasury. When the
//!   treasury does not take them, they go back to the player.
//! - A withdrawal takes the coins from the treasury first, then gives them to the player. When
//!   the player does not get them, the treasury takes them back.
//! - Coins that can reach neither the player nor the treasury (the player left, its sim refused
//!   them, the company is gone) become a debt to the player in the database (world migration
//!   0031); the player gets them when it is next online.
//! - The daily withdrawal limit counts the withdrawals that reached the player, and the ones on
//!   their way.
//!
//! Answers (Observed: a withdrawal gets 5200 with `TREASURY_SUCCESS`, a deposit 5201 with its
//! amount). A refused withdrawal gets 5200 with the client's `GuildTreasuryResponse` reason
//! (Inferred values, see `nw_messages::social::guilds`). A refused deposit gets 5201 with amount
//! 0 (Inferred: 5201 carries no reason, and no capture holds a refused deposit).
//!
//! Each coin move has an id ([`CoinTransfer::id`]): the service asks the same sim again with the
//! same id when no answer came, and the sim moves the coins of one id once, so a lost or late
//! answer never moves coins twice. A move still unanswered after every attempt (its sim is gone)
//! counts as not done, and the coins go the way that loses none (Inferred): an unanswered
//! deposit becomes a debt to the player, an unanswered withdrawal goes back to the treasury. Only
//! a sim that moved the coins, saved the player and stopped before any answer can so give coins
//! twice.
//!
//! **Territory upkeep** (territory upkeep study 2026-11-11): a member's sim asks for a payment
//! (2738, [`nw_bus::SocialInput::PayUpkeep`]) after it checked the claim and the cost. The
//! service checks the member's right and the treasury, then the database takes the cost from the
//! treasury and moves the claim's due time in one transaction (it refuses a company that does
//! not own the claim, or a payment before the upkeep is payable); the payer's sim is told
//! ([`Effect::UpkeepAnswered`]) and the members get the new treasury (Observed: the company state
//! with the treasury came 136 ms after the retail payment, `pay-territory-tax` 1783335287246).
//! Retail sent the payer no answer message (no `TerritoryInteractorComponentClientFacet` message
//! carries an upkeep result), so the payer's sim is told of a refused payment too, and it shows the
//! payer's desk its governance data again ([`UpkeepAnswer::paid`] false).
