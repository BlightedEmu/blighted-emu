//! The player attack table (`player-attacks-<build>.json`, made by `content-tool player-attacks`
//! from the game paks; combat audit, 2026-09-18).
//!
//! A player's weapon puts its `MannequinTag` tags on the character (its stance). The stance picks
//! the Mannequin fragments of the basic attacks: `Attack_Start_Charge` starts at the attack key's
//! press and holds the transitions to the light attack (the key let go), the heavy attack (let
//! go after the heavy hold) and the charged attack (held to the end of the charge). Each attack's
//! fragment holds when it hits: a melee attack's `CAGE-Damage` window and its `Homing`, a ranged
//! attack's `CAGE-RangedAttack`, a magic attack's `CAGE-CastSpell` (the projectile of its
//! `SpellData` row). The ranged attack database (`rangedattackdatabase.radb`) gives a
//! projectile's range and radius, its slice how it flies. The stance's `Dodge_Roll` gives the
//! roll's invulnerability, its `Use` fragments when an item takes effect.
//!
//! Melee shapes (build 25810808, 2026-09-18): each `CAGE-Damage` clip casts its shape on the
//! weapon (the attach database's clips play in the weapon's context): the weapon's joint, its
//! offset and rotation, sampled at each clip frame of the attack's animation over the clip's
//! window, as a transform in the character's root (`Xform`) space ([`MeleeShape`]). Combos: an
//! attack's `CAGE-Transition*` clips to a later charge action, on `CanAttack_Heavy` (the attack key
//! pressed), start the next step of the stance's chain ([`ComboLink`], [`ChargeStep`]). A stance
//! tag that a status effect sets (`SetMannequinTag` of an action active while the effect is on,
//! `GenericTagA` for `Greatsword_Stance_Offense`) gives a variant of the stance ([`Stance::variants`]).
